## Abstract
### The numbers about evangelically pursued best practices in PHP projects
by Muhammed Emin AKBULUT

The field of software engineering has a great source of scientific research about
how to achieve quality using software metrics. There is a great amount of software
developers who ’evangelically’ pursue quality by proposing best practices with little
or no base in academic research. What is the correlation between ’best practices’
and the quality in the context of PHP projects? We measured two highly popular
best practices, SOLID and Calisthenics, in the top 500 PHP projects in GitHub with
25404 distinct versions. SOLID has a 0.73 correlation score with quality metrics,
Calisthenics has a 0.85 correlation score with quality metrics. During our research
we created a SOLID rule set to measure violations of the SOLID principles in source
code which is a contribution and a unique rule set for the PHP community. We
conclude that there is a high correlation between best practices and quality. These
best practices do improve the overall quality of software.
